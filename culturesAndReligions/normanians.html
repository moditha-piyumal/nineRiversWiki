      After their defeat at the hands of the Joonists in Busarish the Normanians became vary of outsiders. A great engineer among their tribe presented a solution to counter the Joonist problem. With his advice they became experts at building hill forts in the mountain terrain they live in. They have strong stone made forts which can withstand a siege for many years. The Normanians are known as great defenders and since their defeat at Busarish they have not lost any territory to any tribe although bothe Joonists and Ukirins have tried to invade the territory of the Normanians.

    All the Normanian villages are forts and they have been built in very defensible locations. However, the most defensible terrain is not the most fertile and the Normanians have little opportunity to be great farmers. They are suspicious of the outsiders and therefore do not trade very much. As they are not the best in farming and trading, the only option left for them is hunting and they are great at hunting. They raise snow leopards as pets and the snow leopards hunt with them. They wear woolen clothing and their culture is a monogamous one but there are many features which make their culture similar to that of the Ukirins. They worship a huge stone in a wooded terrain the location of which no outsider is aware. They believe that their Goddess named "Mari" resides inside this special stone.

      The Red Monks are priests who have dedicated their lives to Mari. And, they are known as talented warlocks. However, other tribes have not seen their talents in battles. The Normanians claim that the red monks can predict weather patterns. The red monks play a great role in ridding the Normanian society of bastards whom they believe are despised by the Goddess Mari. The Goddess is known to love and respect close knit families and that she is known to protect and defend those who do not practice infidelity. Sacrifsing one's life for one's family is seen as a great deed which allows a man or a woman to join Mari in heaven and enjoy the best comforts of the afterlife.

      They have a creation myth which involves the Goddess giving birth to all the planets including the Earth. However, the most spoken about myth is the one about their liberating hero. They believe that a hero will emerge in a thousand years from a great defeat they suffer due to the expansionism of a dangerous tribe. That hero is said to be able to ride atop a flying lizard. He is said to have the ability to unite the world under a single banner. The Normanians believe that all the other tribes who populate the continent are heathens and that their existence is a sin in itself. This world view must have been influenced by the military defeats their tribe faced in the past. Despite these views of the Normanians, their are many tribes who do not view these people with contempt.

      The Normanians are mostly peaceful and they are ruled by lords who rule over villages. There is a powerful lord named Lord Raka who rules over three villages. The Normanians rulers are lawgivers and they make the laws of their villages. But, they do stick to the principles preached by the red monks and the red monks are consulted when decisions are made by the rulers.
