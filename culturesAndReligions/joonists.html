         <h2>Appearance</h2>
         <p>
            Joonists are men and women of pale skin, blue eyes, and red, ginger or blond hair. Being a warlike race, they often wear clothes which are suited to battle. These people wear armour even when they are not at war and even when there is no foreseeable threat in sight. Both men and women wear leather armour and the more successful and wealthy men and women wear metal armour. Although their clothes are well-suited for battle, that does not mean the clothes of the joonists cover their bodies completely. They prefer agility in battle and their clothes help them move quickly through a battlefield.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Joonist men grow beards and women style their hair in any preferred way. Therefore, the women have adopted different hairstyles from the foreigners who visit their shores. Their footwear is suited to the jungles of Sheethlok, where they claim they can defend their territory against an army thousand times greater.
         </p>
         <p>
            The most unpleasant thing about the Joonists is their smell. While the men are always very clean and bathe everyday, the women are barred through tradition from washing their bodies often. Women do wash their bodies above the naval using wet towels, but, only clean up the parts below the naval once every full moon. This leaves an unpleasant smell on the bodies of the Joonist women and may contribute to them having shorter lifespans than their male counterparts.
         </p>
         <p>
            In the Joonist villages where all the men and women know each other, nudity is not scorned upon or discouraged. However, there are almost no public nudity visible in the more populous cities. Children almost always wear little to no clothes before attaining puberty and it is believed among the scholars of the Wama, that once a person's body is exposed to another, there is no shame in exposing it again. Therefore, in an insular village, a person who is born and raised there may find it not at all shameful to expose his or her body to the villagers who have seen him or her naked when he or she was a child.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are no traditional jewellery among the Joonists. Both men and women wear jewellery that they have grabbed from corpses in battlefields. Although there are men and women who wear a lot of jewellery in order to display their skills in battle, this is not a display of a social status in any way.
         </p>

      <!-- Villages and Village-Hubs -->
      <div class="division div_2">
         <h2>Villages and Village-Hubs</h2>
         <p>
            The Joonists live in the southern part of Sheethlok and they live in small villages. However, there are 5 major village-hubs which connect those villages. Each village hub connects about a hundred small villages and people from all those villages visit the hub at least once a month. These are called village hubs but are definitely cities with massive populations. The residents of the cities are always residents of one other village. The village-hubs are centers of trade and industry. Although there are blacksmiths and other craftsmen in small villages, the best of them reside mostly in these cities. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The villages are always created in a wooded terrain and being masters of the forests, the Joonists can easily defend their homes in those woodlands. Their cities are also surrounded by woods and are created in defensible terrain which are full of natural obstacles for an invading army. Their roads are not paved and therefore it is difficult for traders to carry massive amounts of goods at once.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Joonist villages have houses of all sizes and the size of an individual's house reflects the wealth and success of that individual. There are taverns and small temples in every village and usually those public places and places of business are located in the center of the village.
         </p>

      <!-- Leadership and Governance -->
      <div class="division div_3">
         <h2>Leadership and Governance</h2>
         <p>
            The Joonists may seem less civilized to the lords and ladies of the lands of the Wama, but, their system of governance is a symbol of freedom and democracy. Every Joonist man and woman gets to have a say in the decisions made by the village and the village hub.
         </p>
         <p>
            Every year in every Joonist village, there is a gathering, and in this gathering every man and woman is allowed to put forward his or her ideas for the future of the village and the tribe for the upcoming year. This does not mean that long term ideas are not being introduced. There are ideas regarding the expansion of the tribe and development of the village which may last for many years. The village of <span><a href="iskandia.html">Iskandia</a></span> is one such village where the most intelligent and far sighted ideas have lead to an almost unthinkable level of development for a Joonist village. Every year, the Joonists in every village elect a village leader, called a Joon. A Joon only holds the leadership role for one year and the next year he or she must make way for another. However, after the lapse of one year from stepping down from the role of the Joon, a former Joon can be elected again to lead the village. However, the Joon is not supposed to act on his own wishes and whims. He is elected to lead the village to achieve the goals and policies agreed upon at the yearly gathering. The elected Joon immediately appoints a Joonlet to represent his or her village in the village hub they belong to.
         </p>
         <p>
            The appointed Joonlets arrive at the village hub which his or her respective village belongs to and join the Janis, which is a grand assembly where representatives(Joonlets) from each village gather to make decisions affecting all the villages within the village hub. There are no leaders in this assembly. But, there is a man who controls the assembly so that it does not waste time debating in an unproductive manner. This man who controls the assembly is a priest and he commands a considerable security force which has the power to imprison and temporarily remove Joonlets from the assembly. In the Joonist culture, leadership is seen as a responsiblity than a privilege or an honor. So, there are usually no fights over any of the aforementioned leadership roles.
         </p>

      <!-- Social status and Wealth -->
      <div class="division div_4">
         



         <h2>Social status</h2>
         <p>
            Joonists do not believe in hereditary noble titles. They believe that social status should be depended upon wealth a man or a woman possesses. In the Joonist villages every man and every woman has a separate house. A man or a woman should be able to build a house on his/her own to be considered worthy of staying a member of the village after adulthood. So, the wealthier Joonists hire others to build their homes and there are homes which are even three levels tall. Wealth grants social status and wealth can take away social status.
         </p>
         <p>
            As children inherit certain properties of their mothers, they may have a chance to start their life with a good start, if the mother was wealthy. The children of poor mothers are also taught certain life skills which can help them build considerably good houses on their own. Therefore, no one is homeless in the Joonist tribes, those who are too weak to build their own house or too poor to hire others to do it for them, are expelled from the tribes and shunned from the society. It cannot be said that these homeless Joonists are the lowest in the social hierarchy, because they are not considered a part of the Joonist tribes.
         </p>
         <p>
            Joonists treat visitors from other lands with suspicion and foreigners are not allowed to stay a night in a Joonist village or a town. Even the poorest or else the Joonists from the lowest social ranks are treated better than a visitor. The wealthiest Joonists have servants. The servants do not have a lower social rank simply because they serve another. If the servant is well paid, the servant may have more wealth than certain Joonist merchants. Foreigners often believe that Joonists only respect skill and that the more talented ones are those who hold the highest ranks in the society. It is a common misconception because the wealthiest ones are the most respected people. How they earned the wealth is not considered important. If a child inherits more wealth than a self made merchant, the child will get more respect from the village. In the lands of Joonists, social status and respect is entertwined with wealth.

      <!-- Religion -->
      <div class="division div_5">
         <h2>Religious Practices</h2>
         <p>
            Joonists believe in a holy book called Jamapada. This book is originally a long stone inscription which is located in a temple inside the forests in the Joonist lands. There are copies of this "Jamapada" in all the villages and there are wise women who are taught from a young age to read the holy books. There are other holy books of the Jamapada religion. Every village has a woman who is the major wise woman of the village and she has novices. One of the novices will take the place of the wise woman when she is dead and there is a terrifying ritual to select which novice should take the place of the wise woman. The novices are subjected a torture and the novice who can take most of the pain inflicted without shedding a tear will become the next wise woman and all others will be her subordinates. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Joonists are definitely not the most religious group of people. There are some men who never visit the village temple. Lack of enthusiasm in religious activities is not frowned upon by the society. The Joons and Joonlets usually take advice from the wise women. The temple of Jama is the most holy site in their religion and it is located deep within the jungles beyond the areas populated by the Joonists. It is known that a man has to walk through the thick jungle for 10 days to reach the temple of Jama. But, it is unlikely that such a well visited place does not have a proper access road. There are foreigners who visit this temple as well, and they all say that there is a wide unpaved road leading to the temple. No weapons are allowed within ten miles of the temple.
         </p>
         <p>
            Joonists practice human sacrifice and they believe that every man or woman or even a child they kill in combat is a gift to the Gods of their religion. The Joonist religion is simply called the Joonist faith and the Joonists call their religion the Faith. They do not believe that there can be other faiths and even the Joonist mechants who have travelled far and wide believe that all the different religions they see are different versions of their own faith. There is a ceremony of human sacrifices each year in the temple of Jama and only Joonists are allowed to attend and this practice is very secretive. Nobody knows the scale of the practice of human sacrifices. This practice helps the Joonists make peace with their warlike traditions.
         </p>
         <p>
            The religion of the Joonists does not encourage rampant violence. Violence should have a cause. Therefore, the wars among the Joonists are limted to ones which arise from grave offences committed by one tribe upon another. A Joonist tribe called Rama was completely wiped off the land by other tribes because their Joon decided to conquer the neighboring village. There are survivors of the Rama tribe still living in the Mid-lands, but, they definitely have no chance surviving in the Higher-lands because the other Joonist tribes are extremely hostile against them. Joonists are not interested in military expansion of their tribal lands, but, they do believe in expanding their influence. They conquered a city in the Mid-lands called Seekotuwa hundred years ago and even today, Seekotuwa is a vassal state of the Joonist tribes. There are several none Joonist cities and villages who are influenced by the Joonists. Their religion approves subjugation of other groups of people, but, never genocide and even cultural expansion is not considered necessary. Therefore, even those who are subjected to Joonist influence, are not filled with hatred towards the Joonist tribes.

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <p>
            The Joonists are arguably the best warriors in the world. Almost every village has a mercenary comapny founded there. These mercenary companies fight in so many wars all around the world. It is said that there shall never come a day where at least one Joonist fighter band is not involved in some battle. These mercenaries are very well paid and the Joonists always store their wealth in their own land and in their own villages. Therefore, the villages which have produced the best and most highly sought out Joonist mecenary companies are the wealthiest. Iskandia is definitely the village which has produced the largest number of mercenary companies and also the most numerous mercenary group called "Bald Vultures". Iskandian mercenaries are not known to be the bravest, but, they are definitely known to be the most innovative, and they sometimes possess military technologies which have never been seen before in battlefields.
         </p>
         <p>
            Joonists are also accomplished merchants and they do export a lot of wolf and sheep skins. It is said that there used to be bears in the forests near the Joonist villages and that the Joonists hunted the bears into extinction. However, there are no bear tropies in even the most long lasting villages. The Joonists are capable of taming certain animals which are usually never approached by humans, such as snow bears and snow leapards. The Joonists are not known for animal husbandry. But, they do keep farm animals. They also do some farming. They are not the best farmers, but, they are self sufficient. Self sufficiency is important to Joonists because Joonists believe that they were a group of people who dominated more than half of the world and that the currently dominant cultures in the Nine Rivers starved their race and drove them into Sheethlok. This is a story and definitely, not the most believed one. The Joonists believe that they were not self sufficient thousands of years ago and that the current owners of the Nine Rivers suddenly stopped the supply of food they were importing to sustain themselves. These stories simply have created a hatred between the Joonists and inhabitants of the Nine Rivers, but, this does not stop merchants from trading between the two continents and Joonists do fight in many wars in the Nine Rivers.
         </p>
         <p>
            Joonists are truly blessed with many iron mines which they use to make the best weapons in the world. They have really good swords which are suited for all sorts of battles. They also have created bows which can shoot arrows further than any bow which any other continent has invented. However, they keep this technology secret and they only use these bows in internal warfare. Joonists do not take pride in conquests, but, they do raid villages of non-Joonist cultures and extract resources. Joonist raids are not brutal and mostly their opponents make deals with them. Joonists do earn a considerable wealth through such raids. However, once a year, Joonists carry out a grand raid and the target of that raid is completely sacked and there will probably be nothing left after the grand raid is over in the target of that grand raid.

         <h2>Language</h2>
         <p>
            The Joonist language is the most relatable language to most people in the world. The language consists of many words derived from other languages. The Joonist language is however, most closely ressembled to the language called the Old Word. The Old Word is a language used by the Ukirins, who are commonly known as the Ice Men. The two languages are almost indistinguishable from one another. The Ukirin believe that their language is older and more superior while the Joonists believe the same about their own language.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Joonist language has many harsh sounding words. The words which may sound good in a poem do not exist in their language. But, there are Joonist poems and some of those poems are sung to a tune. For instance, the Joonist word for "Love" is "Brakarash". The word they use to identify a village is "Karata". The Joonists call foreigners, "Brasasa", and the word sounds very close to the word used to identify an invader. This mirrors their suspicion of the foreign nations.
         </p>
         <p>
            Joonists being a warrior culture is very familiar with killing. They have more than a dozen words for killing people. The words indicate the manner of killing and even the manner of beheading a man is well defined. While beheading a man with a fast swing of a man's sword is identified by one word, the killing of a man by slowly cutting off the head with a knife is known by another. Certain words which may mean a threat in any other language do not mean the same in the Joonist language.

            Venison is the staple food for Joonists. Their forests do provide an abundant source of good meat and they are expert hunters. However, they do have farms and they do rear animals. There are even several villages who have developed a culture of hearding cattle. These villages are located far from the coastline and they heard bison.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Joonists enjoy their food. They take their time with the food and everyday the final meal is taken at leisure with friends and family. There are small parties in almost every village at least once every full moon to enjoy the day's final meal. These parties are held when the village is relatively successful in the day's hunt and definitely during the harvest season.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Joonists are very good at preserving food. Their ancestors have handed down certain good food preservation methods. They use their excess food items to survive the winter. They do hunt in the harsh winters of the Sheethlok, but, game is not abundant. A food item called "Bus" which is a product created by drying meat is very popular among the Joonists.
